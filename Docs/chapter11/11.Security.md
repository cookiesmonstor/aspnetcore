## ASP.NET Core Security Overview(ASP.NET Core安全性概述)
ASP.NET Core enables developers to easily configure and manage security for their apps. ASP.NET Core contains features for managing authentication, authorization, data protection, SSL enforcement, app secrets, anti-request forgery protection, and CORS management. These security features allow you to build robust yet secure ASP.NET Core apps.

ASP.NET Core开发者可以轻松简单的配置和管理他们应用程序的安全性.ASP.NET Core包含一系列功能特性,用于管理:身份认证(authentication),授权(authorization),数据保护(data protection),强制SSL(SSL enforcement),应用程序机密(app secrets),防请求伪造(anti-request forgery protection),跨域资源共享管理(CORS management).通过这些安全特性,你可以构建安全可靠的ASP.NET Core应用程序.

### ASP.NET Core security features(ASP.NET Core安全特性)
ASP.NET Core provides many tools and libraries to secure your apps including built-in Identity providers but you can use 3rd party identity services such as Facebook, Twitter, or LinkedIn. With ASP.NET Core, you can easily manage app secrets, which are a way to store and use confidential information without having to expose it in the code.

ASP.NET Core提供许多用于保护应用程序安全的工具和库,包括内置的提供的Identity,但是你也可以使用第三方标识服务(identity services),例如,Facebook,Twitter或者LinkedIn等.通过ASP.NET Core,你可以简单的管理应用程序机密(app secrets),这是一种存储和使用机密信息的方法,而不需要将其暴露在代码中.

### Authentication vs. Authorization(身份认证vs授权)
Authentication is a process in which a user provides credentials that are then compared to those stored in an operating system, database, app or resource. If they match, users authenticate successfully, and can then perform actions that they are authorized for, during an authorization process. The authorization refers to the process that determines what a user is allowed to do.

身份认证是用户提供凭证(credentials),然后将凭证与存储在操作系统(operating system),数据库(database),应用程序(app)或者资源中的凭证/信息,进行比较的一个过程.过程中,如果凭证匹配,则用户身份认证成功,然后可以执行,授权过程中,授予执行权限的行为(action).授权指的是,决定允许用户做什么的过程.

Another way to think of authentication is to consider it as a way to enter a space, such as a server, database, app or resource, while authorization is which actions the user can perform to which objects inside that space (server, database, or app).

考虑身份认证的另一种方式是,将其视为是否允许进入某个空间的凭证,例如服务器,数据库,应用程序或者资源,而授权则是,用户可以在该空间(服务器,数据库或者应用程序)中的哪些对象上,可执行的操作.

### Common Vulnerabilities in software(软件中的常见漏洞)
ASP.NET Core and EF contain features that help you secure your apps and prevent security breaches. The following list of links takes you to documentation detailing techniques to avoid the most common security vulnerabilities in web apps:
